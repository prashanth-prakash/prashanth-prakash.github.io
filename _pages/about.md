I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University, where I study how speech and language are represented in the human brain using intracranial cortical recordings and machine learning.

My research focuses on neural decoding and brain–computer interfaces for speech, with the goal of understanding and restoring communication in individuals with neurological impairments.

I work at the intersection of human electrophysiology, signal processing, and machine learning, with an emphasis on speech production, language networks, and real-time decoding from cortical signals.

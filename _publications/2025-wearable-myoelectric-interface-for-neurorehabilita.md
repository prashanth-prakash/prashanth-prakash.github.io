excerpt: "Abnormal muscle co-activation contributes to arm impairment after stroke. This single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of home-based, personalized myoelectric interface for neurorehabilitation (MINT) conditioning to reduce abnormal co-activation and enhance arm function and determine the optimal number of abnormally co-activating muscles to target during training."

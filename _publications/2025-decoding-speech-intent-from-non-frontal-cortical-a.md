excerpt: " Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) that can restore speech have predominantly focused on decoding speech signals from the speech motor cortices. A few studies have shown some information outside the speech motor cortices, such as in parietal and temporal lobes, that also may be useful for BMIs. The ability to use information from outside the frontal lobe could be useful not only for people with locked-in syndrome, but also to people with frontal lobe damage, which can cause nonfluent aphasia or apraxia of speech. However, temporal and parietal lobes are predominantly involved in perceptive speech processing and comprehension. Therefore, to be able to use signals from these areas in a speech BMI, it is important to ascertain that they are related to production. Here, using intracranial recordings, we sought evidence for whether, when and where neural information related to speech intent could be found in the temporal and parietal cortices"

excerpt: "High-intensity occupational therapy can improve arm function after stroke, but many people lack access to such therapy. Home-based therapies could address this need, but they don't typically address abnormal muscle co-activation, an important aspect of arm impairment. An earlier study using lab-based, myoelectric computer interface game training enabled chronic stroke survivors to reduce abnormal co-activation and improve arm function. Here, we assess feasibility of doing this training at home using a novel, wearable, myoelectric interface for neurorehabilitation training (MINT) paradigm."

    - Ensemble learning for classification of brain signals
      Applied feature engineering and ensemble classification techniques on EEG signals to decode imagined motor intent. Achieved significant accuracy using ensemble classification techniques like XGBoost and Random Forest. Sought deep learning solutions for better feature extraction.
    - Biologically plausible neural networks
      Helped design an algorithm to address the weight transport problem in neural networks. Successfully tested algorithm in a variety of neural network architectures. Extensively experimented with deep learning architectures using Tensorflow to address this problem. Further working on using causal nature between spiking activity of neurons and reward to hypothesize a biologically plausible gradient update.

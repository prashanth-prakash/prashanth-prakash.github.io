  Hi, my name is Prashanth and I'm a reseaerch technologist at Northwestern University. As part of my research I have worked on signal processing and machine learning algorithms for brain computer interfaces and neuroscience. My interests have been in learning representations in the brain and building decoders that help in translating neural signals to behavior. In addition to my interest in neuroscience, I am always on the lookout for new and interesting projects to work on. I have worked on many machine learning projects in other fields as well. I am currently intersted in exploring machine learning tools used on healthcare data and am open to collaborating on projects, feel free to contact me via email or linkedin.
